                <h3>When Darkness Took Over</h3>
                <p class="description">(How I felt in the depths of depression)</p>
                <p>
                  I don’t know exactly when the sadness began. I remember feeling deeply sad even as a teenager. Simple things would hurt me more than they should, and over time, that sadness grew heavier.
                  At first, I didn’t think it was depression. I read depression meant you couldn’t function — but I was still going to school, getting good grades, eating, helping at home, even going out with friends.
                  Still, inside, I was suffering. I felt so sad I didn’t want to live. I didn’t understand why I felt that way or how to change it.
                  As years passed, these depressive episodes became longer, deeper, and more frequent. I never told anyone, not even my family. I didn’t want to worry them. Because honestly, I didn’t even know how to explain what I was feeling. I didn’t ask for help because I didn’t have the words, and I didn’t want to be a burden.

                <h3>Living a Double Life</h3>
                <p class="description">(How I hid what was happening inside me)</p>
                <p>
                  On the outside, my life seemed normal. But inside, I was constantly thinking about death. I didn’t want to end my life with my own hands — I knew how much that would hurt my parents, and I couldn’t bear the thought of causing them that kind of pain.
                  Instead, I silently wished something would happen to me: an accident, an illness — something that would let me die without it being my fault.
                  I remember that when something (simple things) triggered my depression, I imagined myself jumping from the fifth-floor balcony where I lived. Because I didn’t want to live more. I felt hopeless. Alone. And with no way out.

                <h3>When I Spoke to God</h3>
                <p class="description">(How I prayed and how He answered)</p>
                <p>
                  I grew up in a Catholic family, though not very practicing. I also attended a Catholic school, but I didn’t truly understand the spiritual side of faith — I saw it more as theory. Still, I believed in God. I learned and believed He was omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent. And that simple belief was all I had left. So I started talking to Him.
                  I cried and asked Him if I was doing something wrong to feel like this. I asked if I was a bad person, or if I somehow deserved the pain. Over and over again, I told Him, “God, if You really exist, then You are the only one who knows the answers and what is happening to me — and the only one who can help me.” I spoke to Him constantly, because there was nothing else I could do.
                  As the years passed, things got worse. I felt completely lost and without strength to live. I used to tell God, “God, give me strength to live, because I have none left.” I truly had no strength anymore the last year of depression. I wanted to die, but I also wanted God to save me.

                <h3>The Visit That Changed Everything</h3>
                <p class="description">(How God answered me through someone I didn’t expect)</p>
                <p>
                  After nearly ten years living in that deep depression, something happened. One day, a woman came to visit our home — a pastor. She wasn’t there because of me; she had come to visit a relative. I had heard of pastors before, but I didn’t really know what they did. I had also heard that this particular pastor had a spiritual gift, and that God used her to help people in special ways.
                  At first, I was afraid she might see through me, see all the darkness I had been hiding. The plan was to talk to her and pray for a skin condition I had, but I kept putting it off until the last day of her visit. When we finally sat down to talk, everything changed.
                  She started talking to me about events in my life — personal, painful experiences — things I had never told anyone. Things only God could know. She knew exactly how I felt and began mentioning specific details about my life. She described what she was seeing and sensing — things that God was revealing to her in that moment and I realized: these were the answers I had been asking God for.
                  Through her, God was answering every question I had cried out to Him. It was like watching my entire life unfold in front of me — but this time with clarity, with understanding. I wasn’t the problem. I wasn’t to blame. God had seen me all along. And He was now setting me free.

                <h3>Reflections from the Other Side</h3>
                <p class="description">(What I’ve learned and how I live now)</p>
                <p>
                  Some time after that encounter, I realized something life-changing: I no longer felt depressed.
                  The dark weight I had carried for so long was gone. I could feel joy, peace, and love.
                  It was only in that moment — once I was free — that I understood how deep my depression had been.
                  I learned not to judge others, or myself. Because we never know the pain that hides behind a smile, or the story someone carries in silence.
                  I’ve become more compassionate, more empathetic, and more connected to God than ever before.
                  Since then I started to seek God actively: going to church, reading the Bible, and speaking to Him constantly. Because when you feel God's presence, it fills you with joy, peace, wholeness, and love.
                  I believe I had the kind of faith that moves mountains — faith that didn’t let go of God, even in the darkest moments. And through that faith, God answered me.

                <h3>Why I Share This Story</h3>
                <p class="description">(My desire to help others)</p>
                <p>
                  After everything I’ve lived, I feel a deep desire to help others who are going through what I went through.
                  I know there are people who feel like I did — hopeless, lost, empty — and I want them to know: there is a way out. God can do for them what He did for me.
                  I want to share my story because I believe that faith changes everything.
