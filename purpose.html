      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        To show God's miracles and remind people that He is a God of miracles. He can do anything. He works through supernatural acts and also within this world.
      </p>
      <p>
        I want to share the kind of miracles we read about in the Bible, the ones we often think are no longer possible. These are miracles that cannot be explained by human logic, science, or reason.
      </p>

      <p>
        The purpose of this blog is to share and highlight God's miracles, reminding everyone that He is still a God of wonders today. Many people believe miracles were only for biblical times or dismiss them because they defy human logic, science, or reason. But God can do anything. He works through the natural world and through supernatural acts that go beyond our understanding.
I want to bring attention to the miracles described in the Bible and show that these kinds of extraordinary works are still possible. God acts in ways that surpass our expectations and understanding. He uses anything for His purpose, and He still performs incredible, supernatural things today.
I also want to tell everyone that no matter what situation or difficulty you’re going through, God is with you and He hears you. He makes the impossible possible and brings peace to your life. This space is like a journal where God writes and collects His miracles through me. This website is simply the channel to share them.
This blog is an invitation to rediscover and strengthen the kind of faith that moves mountains—a faith many have lost. It is a reminder to believe that with God, all things are possible, and that nothing is too difficult for Him.
